            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p id="ME">
                Venezuela was my home.
                I made the decision to come to the U.S. in 2015 due to the critical situation that has impacted my
                country, leaving behind my family, and the career I was pursuing in systems engineering. I started my
                new life without speaking a word of english but determined to succeed. In a few years, I was able to
                speak, write and read english and pursue goals that would have never been possible in my home country.
                One of my greatest discoveries was my passion for programming. I became eager to learn and took it into
                my own hands to teach myself, creating my first fully functional website for a local restaurant,
                utilizing html and css. From then on, I decided to pursue a career as a web developer and have been
                working endlessly towards expanding my skill set.
